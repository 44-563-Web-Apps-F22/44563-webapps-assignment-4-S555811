        (THE NEXT MORNING.)

        <span style="color:green">SCENE.—Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.
      
        Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company (now
              dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida), carrying
              garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and
              heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage
              ceremony, which has just taken place.

        CHORUS.
        <br>
        <br>
      
              As before you we defile,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
              Pray you, gentles, do not smile
              If we shout, in classic style,
                          Eloia!
              Ludwig and his Julia true
              Wedded are each other to—
              So we sing, till all is blue,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
                          Opoponax!  Eloia!
      
              Wreaths of bay and ivy twine,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
              Fill the bowl with Lesbian wine,
              And to revelry incline—
                          Eloia!
      
              For as gaily we pass on
              Probably we shall, anon,
              Sing a Diergeticon—
                          Eloia! Eloia!
                          Opoponax! Eloia!

        RECIT.—LUDWIG.
        <br>
        <br>
      
              Your loyalty our Ducal heartstrings touches:
              Allow me to present your new Grand Duchess.
              Should she offend, you'll graciously excuse her—
              And kindly recollect I didn't choose her!
      
                               SONG—LUDWIG.
      
        At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention
              To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,
        For the company possesses all the necessary dresses
              And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the
        rest.
        We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)
              Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age,
        And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster
              Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage.
        This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,
              Which are always calculated by the day or by the week—
        And I'll pay 'em (if they'll back me) all in oboloi and drachm,
              Which they'll get (if they prefer it) at the Kalends that
                    are Greek!
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
              At this juncture I may mention
                    That this erudition sham
              Is but classical pretension,
                    The result of steady "cram.":
              Periphrastic methods spurning,
              To this audience discerning
              I admit this show of learning
                    Is the fruit of steady "cram."!
      <br>
      <br>

        CHORUS. 
        <br>
        <br>

            Periphrastic methods, etc.
      
        In the period Socratic every dining-room was Attic
              (Which suggests an architecture of a topsy-turvy kind),
        There they'd satisfy their thirst on a recherche cold {Greek
        word}
              Which is what they called their lunch—and so may you if
                    you're inclined.
        As they gradually got on, they'd {four Greek words)
              (Which is Attic for a steady and a conscientious drink).
        But they mixed their wine with water—which I'm sure they didn't
                    oughter—
              And we modern Saxons know a trick worth two of that, I
                    think!
        Then came rather risky dances (under certain circumstances)
              Which would shock that worthy gentleman, the Licenser of
                    Plays,
        Corybantian maniac kick—Dionysiac or Bacchic—
              And the Dithyrambic revels of those undecorous days.
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
                    And perhaps I'd better mention,
                          Lest alarming you I am,
                    That it isn't our intention
                          To perform a Dithyramb—
                    It displays a lot of stocking,
                    Which is always very shocking,
                    And of course I'm only mocking
                          At the prevalence of "cram"!
      <br>
      <br>

        CHORUS.   
        <br>
        <br>

                      It displays a lot, etc.
      
        Yes, on reconsideration, there are customs of that nation
              Which are not in strict accordance with the habits of our
                    day,
        And when I come to codify, their rules I mean to modify,
              Or Mrs. Grundy, p'r'aps, may have a word or two to say.
        For they hadn't macintoshes or umbrellas or goloshes—
              And a shower with their dresses must have played the very
                    deuce,
        And it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of
                    sneezing,
              For, it seems, of pocket-handkerchiefs they didn't know the
                    use.
        They wore little underclothing—scarcely anything—or nothing—
              And their dress of Coan silk was quite transparent in
                    design—
        Well, in fact, in summer weather, something like the "altogether"
              And it's there, I rather fancy, I shall have to draw the
                    line!
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
                    And again I wish to mention
                          That this erudition sham
                    Is but classical pretension,
                          The result of steady "cram."
                    Yet my classic lore aggressive
                    (If you'll pardon the possessive)
                    Is exceedingly impressive
                          When you're passing an exam.
      <br>

      <br>

        CHORUS.  
        <br>  
        <br>

                 Yet his classic lore, etc.
                 <br>

      
            <span Style="color:red">[Exeunt Chorus.  Manent LUDWIG, JULIA, and LISA.</span>

      <br>

        LUD. (recit.).
        <br>

                    Yes, Ludwig and his Julia are mated!
              For when an obscure comedian, whom the law backs,
                    To sovereign rank is promptly elevated,
              He takes it with its incidental drawbacks!
                    So Julia and I are duly mated!
      <br>
        <span style="color:red">(LISA, through this, has expressed intense distress at
            having to surrender LUDWIG.)
</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    SONG—LISA.
    <br>
    <br>

      
              Take care of him—he's much too good to live,
                    With him you must be very gentle:
              Poor fellow, he's so highly sensitive,
                    And O, so sentimental!
              Be sure you never let him sit up late
                    In chilly open air conversing—
              Poor darling, he's extremely delicate,
                    And wants a deal of nursing!
      <br>
      <br>
        LUD. 
        <br>
        <br>
               I want a deal of nursing!
      
        LISA.       And O, remember this—
                          When he is cross with pain,
                    A flower and a kiss—
                    A simple flower—a tender kiss
                          Will bring him round again!
      
              His moods you must assiduously watch:
                    When he succumbs to sorrow tragic,
              Some hardbake or a bit of butter-scotch
                    Will work on him like magic.
              To contradict a character so rich
                    In trusting love were simple blindness—
              He's one of those exalted natures which
                    Will only yield to kindness!
      
        LUD.        I only yield to kindness!
      
        LISA.       And O, the bygone bliss!
                          And O, the present pain!
                    That flower and that kiss—
                    That simple flower—that tender kiss
                          I ne'er shall give again!
      
         <br>
                                                            
        weeping.
      
        <br>
        speaking (conversatipon)<br> 
              JULIA.  And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
        and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
        new-born husband.
              LUD. (aside).  Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
        with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?
              JULIA.  Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
        play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
        to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
        Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
        Duchess.
              LUD.  Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
        make
        a very fine part of it.
              JULIA.  Why, that's quite my idea.
              LUD.  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
        viragoes.
              JULIA.  You think not?
              LUD.  Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a
        tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate (but not too
        affectionate) child-wife—timidly anxious to coil herself into
        her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
        for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
        appearance.
              JULIA.  Oh, that is your idea of a good part?
              LUD.  Yes—a wife who regards her husband's slightest wish
        as an inflexible law, and who ventures but rarely into his august
        presence, unless (which would happen seldom) he should summon her
        to appear before him.  A crushed, despairing violet, whose
        blighted existence would culminate (all too soon) in a lonely and
        pathetic death-scene!  A fine part, my dear.
              JULIA.  Yes.  There's a good deal to be said for your view
        of it.  Now there are some actresses whom it would fit like a
        glove.
              LUD.  (aside).  I wish I'd married one of 'em!
              JULIA.  But, you see, I must consider my temperament. For
        instance, my temperament would demand some strong scenes of
        justifiable jealousy.
              LUD.  Oh, there's no difficulty about that.  You shall have
        them.
              JULIA.  With a lovely but detested rival—
              LUD.  Oh, I'll provide the rival.
              JULIA.  Whom I should stab—stab—stab!
              LUD.  Oh, I wouldn't stab her.  It's been done to death.  I
        should treat her with a silent and contemptuous disdain, and
        delicately withdraw from a position which, to one of your
        sensitive nature, would be absolutely untenable.  Dear me, I can
        see you delicately withdrawing, up centre and off!
              JULIA.  Can you?
              LUD.  Yes.  It's a fine situation—and in your hands, full
        of quiet pathos!
      
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        DUET—LUDWIG and JULIA.

        <br>
        <br>
      
        LUD.        Now Julia, come,
                    Consider it from
                          This dainty point of view—
                    A timid tender
                    Feminine gender,
                          Prompt to coyly coo—
                    Yet silence seeking,
                    Seldom speaking
                          Till she's spoken to—
                    A comfy, cosy,
                    Rosy-posy
                          Innocent ingenoo!
                                The part you're suited to—
                                (To give the deuce her due)
                          A sweet (O, jiminy!)
                          Miminy-piminy,
                                Innocent ingenoo!
      
                                  ENSEMBLE.
      
                    LUD.                                JULIA.
      
        The part you're suited to—         I'm much obliged to you,
        (To give the deuce her due)         I don't think that would do—
              A sweet (O, jiminy!)                To play (O, jiminy!)
              Miminy-piminy,                      Miminy-piminy,
        Innocent ingenoo!                   Innocent ingenoo!
      
        JULIA.      You forget my special magic
                          (In a high dramatic sense)
                    Lies in situations tragic—
                          Undeniably intense.
                    As I've justified promotion
                          In the histrionic art,
                    I'll submit to you my notion
                          Of a first-rate part.
                          LUD.        Well, let us see your notion
                          Of a first-rate part.
      
        JULIA (dramatically).
              I have a rival!  Frenzy-thrilled,
                    I find you both together!
              My heart stands still—with horror chilled—-
                    Hard as the millstone nether!
              Then softly, slyly, snaily, snaky—
              Crawly, creepy, quaily, quaky—
                    I track her on her homeward way,
                    As panther tracks her fated prey!
      
        (Furiously.)      I fly at her soft white throat—
                    The lily-white laughing leman!
              On her agonized gaze I gloat
                    With the glee of a dancing demon!
              My rival she—I have no doubt of her—-
              So I hold on—till the breath is out of her!
                          —till the breath is out of her!
      
              And then—Remorse! Remorse!
              O cold unpleasant corse,
                          Avaunt! Avaunt!
                    That lifeless form
                          I gaze upon—
                    That face, still warm
                          But weirdly wan—
                    Those eyes of glass
                          I contemplate—
                    And then, alas!
                          Too late—too late!
                    I find she is—your Aunt!
        (Shuddering.)     Remorse!  Remorse!
      
              Then, mad—mad—mad!
                    With fancies wild—chimerical—
              Now sorrowful—silent—sad—
                    Now hullaballoo hysterical!
                          Ha! ha! ha! ha!
              But whether I'm sad or whether I'm glad,
                    Mad! mad! mad! mad!
      
              This calls for the resources of a high-class art,
              And satisfies my notion of a first-rate part!
