    <h4>Act 2</h4>

    <p>
        (THE NEXT MORNING.)
<br>
        <P class="direction">SCENE.—Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.
      
            Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company (now
                   dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida), carrying
                   garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and
                   heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage
                   ceremony, which has just taken place.</P>

            <p class="SONG">    As before you we defile,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
                  Pray you, gentles, do not smile
                  If we shout, in classic style,
                          Eloia!
                  Ludwig and his Julia true
                  Wedded are each other to—
                  So we sing, till all is blue,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
                          Opoponax!  Eloia!
      
                   Wreaths of bay and ivy twine,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
                   Fill the bowl with Lesbian wine,
                   And to revelry incline—
                          Eloia!
      
                   For as gaily we pass on
                   Probably we shall, anon,
                   Sing a Diergeticon—
                          Eloia! Eloia!
                          Opoponax! Eloia!  </p>

       <p class="SONG"> At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention
              To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,
        For the company possesses all the necessary dresses
              And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the
        rest.
        We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)
              Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age,
        And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster
              Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage.
        This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,
              Which are always calculated by the day or by the week—
        And I'll pay 'em (if they'll back me) all in oboloi and drachm,
              Which they'll get (if they prefer it) at the Kalends that
                    are Greek!
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
              At this juncture I may mention
                    That this erudition sham
              Is but classical pretension,
                    The result of steady "cram.":
              Periphrastic methods spurning,
              To this audience discerning
              I admit this show of learning
                    Is the fruit of steady "cram."! </p>

                <p class="speech">Yes, Ludwig and his Julia are mated!
                  For when an obscure comedian, whom the law backs,
                        To sovereign rank is promptly elevated,
                  He takes it with its incidental drawbacks!
                        So Julia and I are duly mated!</p>

                  and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
                  new-born husband.</p> 
             <h6 class="LUDWIG">LUD</h6> <p class="speech">(aside).  Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
                  with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?</p>. 
              <h6 class="JULIA">JULIA</h6> <p class="speech">Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
                  play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
                  to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
                  Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
                  Duchess.</p> 
              <h6 class="LUDWIG">LUD</h6> <p class="speech">Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
                  make</p> 
        a very fine part of it.
             <h6 class="JULIA">JULIA</h6>  <p class="speech"> Why, that's quite my idea.</p>
              <h6 class="LUDWIG">LUD</h6>  <p class="speech">I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
                  viragoes.</p>
              <h6 class="JULIA">JULIA</h6> <p class="speech"> You think not?</p>
              <h6 class="LUDWIG">LUD</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a
                  tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate (but not too
                  affectionate) child-wife—timidly anxious to coil herself into
                  her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
                  for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
                  appearance.</p>
              <h6 class="JULIA">JULIA</h6> <p class="speech"> Oh, that is your idea of a good part?</p>
             <h6 class="LUDWIG">LUD</h6>  <p> Yes—a wife who regards her husband's slightest wish
                  as an inflexible law, and who ventures but rarely into his august
                  presence, unless (which would happen seldom) he should summon her
                  to appear before him.  A crushed, despairing violet, whose
                  blighted existence would culminate (all too soon) in a lonely and
                  pathetic death-scene!  A fine part, my dear</p>
              <h6 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h6><p class="speech"> Yes.  There's a good deal to be said for your view
                  of it.  Now there are some actresses whom it would fit like a
                  glove.</p>
