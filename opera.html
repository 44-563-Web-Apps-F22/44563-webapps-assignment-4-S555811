    <h3>The Grand Duke</h3>
    <h4>Act 2</h4>


    <p>
        (THE NEXT MORNING.)
<br>
        <span style="color:green">SCENE.—Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.
      
        Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company (now
              dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida), carrying
              garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and
              heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage
              ceremony, which has just taken place.

        <br>
      
        CHORUS.
        <br>
        <br>
      
              As before you we defile,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
              Pray you, gentles, do not smile
              If we shout, in classic style,
                          Eloia!
              Ludwig and his Julia true
              Wedded are each other to—
              So we sing, till all is blue,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
                          Opoponax!  Eloia!
      
              Wreaths of bay and ivy twine,
                          Eloia!  Eloia!
              Fill the bowl with Lesbian wine,
              And to revelry incline—
                          Eloia!
      
              For as gaily we pass on
              Probably we shall, anon,
              Sing a Diergeticon—
                          Eloia! Eloia!
                          Opoponax! Eloia!
      <br>
      <br>
        RECIT.—LUDWIG.
        <br>
        <br>
      
              Your loyalty our Ducal heartstrings touches:
              Allow me to present your new Grand Duchess.
              Should she offend, you'll graciously excuse her—
              And kindly recollect I didn't choose her!
      
                               SONG—LUDWIG.
      
        At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention
              To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,
        For the company possesses all the necessary dresses
              And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the
        rest.
        We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)
              Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age,
        And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster
              Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage.
        This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,
              Which are always calculated by the day or by the week—
        And I'll pay 'em (if they'll back me) all in oboloi and drachm,
              Which they'll get (if they prefer it) at the Kalends that
                    are Greek!
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
              At this juncture I may mention
                    That this erudition sham
              Is but classical pretension,
                    The result of steady "cram.":
              Periphrastic methods spurning,
              To this audience discerning
              I admit this show of learning
                    Is the fruit of steady "cram."!
      <br>
      <br>

        CHORUS. 
        <br>
        <br>

            Periphrastic methods, etc.
      
        In the period Socratic every dining-room was Attic
              (Which suggests an architecture of a topsy-turvy kind),
        There they'd satisfy their thirst on a recherche cold {Greek
        word}
              Which is what they called their lunch—and so may you if
                    you're inclined.
        As they gradually got on, they'd {four Greek words)
              (Which is Attic for a steady and a conscientious drink).
        But they mixed their wine with water—which I'm sure they didn't
                    oughter—
              And we modern Saxons know a trick worth two of that, I
                    think!
        Then came rather risky dances (under certain circumstances)
              Which would shock that worthy gentleman, the Licenser of
                    Plays,
        Corybantian maniac kick—Dionysiac or Bacchic—
              And the Dithyrambic revels of those undecorous days.
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
                    And perhaps I'd better mention,
                          Lest alarming you I am,
                    That it isn't our intention
                          To perform a Dithyramb—
                    It displays a lot of stocking,
                    Which is always very shocking,
                    And of course I'm only mocking
                          At the prevalence of "cram"!
      <br>
      <br>

        CHORUS.   
        <br>
        <br>

                      It displays a lot, etc.
      
        Yes, on reconsideration, there are customs of that nation
              Which are not in strict accordance with the habits of our
                    day,
        And when I come to codify, their rules I mean to modify,
              Or Mrs. Grundy, p'r'aps, may have a word or two to say.
        For they hadn't macintoshes or umbrellas or goloshes—
              And a shower with their dresses must have played the very
                    deuce,
        And it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of
                    sneezing,
              For, it seems, of pocket-handkerchiefs they didn't know the
                    use.
        They wore little underclothing—scarcely anything—or nothing—
              And their dress of Coan silk was quite transparent in
                    design—
        Well, in fact, in summer weather, something like the "altogether"
              And it's there, I rather fancy, I shall have to draw the
                    line!
      
        (Confidentially to audience.)
                    And again I wish to mention
                          That this erudition sham
                    Is but classical pretension,
                          The result of steady "cram."
                    Yet my classic lore aggressive
                    (If you'll pardon the possessive)
                    Is exceedingly impressive
                          When you're passing an exam.
      <br>

      <br>

        CHORUS.  
        <br>  
        <br>

                 Yet his classic lore, etc.
                 <br>

      
            <span Style="color:red">[Exeunt Chorus.  Manent LUDWIG, JULIA, and LISA.</span> 
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>

        LUD. (recit.).
        <br>

                    Yes, Ludwig and his Julia are mated!
              For when an obscure comedian, whom the law backs,
                    To sovereign rank is promptly elevated,
              He takes it with its incidental drawbacks!
                    So Julia and I are duly mated!
      <br>
        <span style="color:red">(LISA, through this, has expressed intense distress at
            having to surrender LUDWIG.)
</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    SONG—LISA.
    <br>
    <br>

      
              Take care of him—he's much too good to live,
                    With him you must be very gentle:
              Poor fellow, he's so highly sensitive,
                    And O, so sentimental!
              Be sure you never let him sit up late
                    In chilly open air conversing—
              Poor darling, he's extremely delicate,
                    And wants a deal of nursing!
      <br>
      <br>
        LUD. 
        <br>
        <br>
               I want a deal of nursing!
      
        LISA.       And O, remember this—
                          When he is cross with pain,
                    A flower and a kiss—
                    A simple flower—a tender kiss
                          Will bring him round again!
      
              His moods you must assiduously watch:
                    When he succumbs to sorrow tragic,
              Some hardbake or a bit of butter-scotch
                    Will work on him like magic.
              To contradict a character so rich
                    In trusting love were simple blindness—
              He's one of those exalted natures which
                    Will only yield to kindness!
      
        LUD.        I only yield to kindness!
      
        LISA.       And O, the bygone bliss!
                          And O, the present pain!
                    That flower and that kiss—
                    That simple flower—that tender kiss
                          I ne'er shall give again!
      
         <br>
